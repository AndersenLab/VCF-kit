VCF-kit - [Documentation](http://vcf-kit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
===========

VCF-kit is a command-line based collection of utilities for performing analysis on Variant Call Format (VCF) files. A summary of the commands is provided below.

| Command |Description                                                                                 |
|:----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __calc__ | Obtain  frequency/count of  genotypes and alleles.                                               |
| __call__ | Compare variants  identified  from  sequences obtained  through alternative methods against a VCF. |
| __filter__ | Filter  variants  with  a minimum or  maximum number  of  REF,  HET,  ALT,  or  missing calls.         |
| __geno__ | Various operations  at  the genotype  level.                                                      |
| __genome__ | Reference genome  processing  and management.                                                  |
| __hmm__ | Hidden-markov model for use in  imputing  genotypes from  parental  genotypes in  linkage studies.   |
| __phylo__ | Generate  dendrograms from  a VCF.                                                              |
| __primer__ | Generate  primers for variant validation.                                                     |
| __rename__ | Add a prefix, suffix, or  substitute  a string  in  sample  names.                                |
| __tajima__ | Calculate Tajimaâ€™s  D.                                                                        |
| __vcf2tsv__ | Convert a VCF to  TSV.                                                                       |

## Installation

__VCF-Kit has been upgraded to Python 3__

VCF-kit has been tested with Python 3.7. The easiest way to install VCF-kit is by using Conda.

#### Conda

```
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda create -n vcf-kit python=2.7 vcfkit
```

#### Manually

You may need to install matplotlib. On linux this can be done with:

```
sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib
```

On OSX it can be installed using:

```
pip install matplotlib  
```

You may need to install a few additional dependencies:
 
```
pip install yahmm
pip install numpy
pip install VCF-kit
```

__Installing Dependencies:__

In addition to python, VCF-kit requires that a number of additional programs be installed. We recommend using conda to install dependencies:

```bash
conda install -y "bwa>=0.7.12" \
                 "samtools>=1.10" \
                 "bcftools>=1.10" \
                 "blast>=2.2.31" \
                 "muscle>=3.8.31" \
                 "primer3>=2.5.0"
```

__External Dependencies__

* bwa (v 0.7.12)
* samtools (v 1.3)
* bcftools (v 1.3)
* blast (v 2.2.31+)
* muscle (v 3.8.31)
* primer3 (v 2.5.0)
